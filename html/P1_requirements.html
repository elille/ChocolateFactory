					Purpose
				</h2>
			</header>
                <p>
                    Wonka wants to bring his products to a broader customer base, and also bring in new ideas for new product lines for the company to create.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The site would optimally present the different products the company already has, but also contain a community-oriented way for customers to suggest new products that they want. The competitions are a trademark of the factory, and is a good way to get publicity to increase the customer base.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Additionally it would present the company's profile and long history, and a list of employees of special mention. This is to let people know what a special company this is. Additionally, helping the public understand the obsession with quality the company has gives them a better chance of building a positive relationship with the public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like all other companies the factory needs employees, and as such there will be a section for people looking for work. These will be told a little bit about how it is to work in the factory, and what is expected from them. They will be interested in knowing that the factory employs a special working people called Oompah Loompas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some users will want to get in touch with representatives for the company and will need information about how to do this. It is important for the company that the customers are satisfied with the products they provide, and so it is imperative that they have some way of letting the company know when they are dissapointed. All production companies sometimes make faulty products, and it is therefore important to be humble enough to accept that this might be a problem.

					Intended audience
				</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Mainly the audience of the website is potential customers. These visitors will need to be provided with information about products, and exposed to as much publicity as possible.
                Candy is for the fun-loving people and so these visitors will be provided with chances to participate in fun competitions. It is expected that children will make up a big portion of the customer base, and therefore everything will need to be easily understandable and in a children-friendly style. Background info about the factory is also provided should some of these be particularly interested. To not miss out on a lot of creativity, a medium to give these users the chance to propose new products is also provided.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some customers might want to complain about products and purchases, or might have other feedback. This will therefore be provided and presented in a down to earth way.
                <br>Another small user base will be people looking for employment. These will need information about open positions and how to get in touch with the people responsible for employing new people.

            <p>
                We want to make the site fast to load with consideration to common internet bandwidth in Norway. In our case it means to be conscious about image size in pictures used at our page. We also want our site to be easily manoeuverable. A site map, and top menu with simple links will help the site give a good user experience.
