				Our client is Willy Wonka, an entrepreneur running his own chocolate factory in Trondheim. He specializes in making candies he wants to make, not necessarily catering to what may make financial sense.

					Purpose, goals and audience

			</header>
			<p>
                The purpose of the website is to show potential customers and partners what the company is all about, presenting both Willy himself and the company. It also aims to present the different products the company makes, and give the public the chance to suggest new products for the company to make. The page aims to inform, educate and entertain potential customers of all ages, and does this by being both whimsical in its design, while still retaining the necessary information to be a serious information service.

				<h2>
					Navigation Structure
				</h2>
			</header>
			<h3>The navbar</h3>
			<p>
				The navbar can be seen in all the subpages of the website, and is used to navigate through the pages. It consists of a logo, which is also a hyperlink to the front page, and a chocolate bar styled navigation panel. This is done by using a rectangular hotspot and an image map. This panel has five buttons, who all leads to one of the following subpages; products, contests, Charlies charities, career and about us.<br>
				The buttons are styled to look like chcolate, but they are also clearly clickable. The logo is a link to the front page because many web pages today uses this convention, and people therefor expect to be taken to the front page by clicking the logo.
			</p>

						The navbar
					</figcaption>
				</a>
            </figure>
			<h3>The front page</h3>
			<p>
				The front page consists of the navbar and three colums containing content. The first column is about the candy, and pressing the heading “candy” or the link “read more” takes you to the subpage “products”. The same concept is used for the middle column, which leads to te subpage “Charlies charities”, and the right column takes you to the subpage called “about”. This allows for the front page to be a short summary of some of the most important information you can find on the page. It also allows for the user to easily find the information they are looking for.
			</p>
			<h3>The products page</h3>
			<p>
				The products page consists of three columns, each containing different content. There is no more information about the products than what can be found on this page, so nothing in these columns is clickable. The last product is blank, and the description has a link that says “suggest a new project”. This link takes you to the subpage “Suggest a new product”.
			</p>
			<h3>Suggest a new product</h3>
			<p>
				This page is a form where the user can suggest a new product. The only way to navigate away from this page is by clicking back in the browser, or using the navbar.
			</p>
			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				This page has a big link to the subpage “Contact us”. The contact us is conventionally placed on the about page.
			</p>
			<h3>Contact us</h3>
			<p>
				The contact us page is a form, and the only way to navigate away from this page is by clicking back in the browser, or using the navbar.
			</p>
			<h3>Contest</h3>
			<p>
				This page does not have any links or clickables. The page can be refreshed to win a tour of the factory. If you win a tour of the factory, a popup containing a golden ticket will appear, and the golden ticket will disappear if you press anywhere on the page outside the golden ticket.
			</p>
			<h3>Charlies charities</h3>
			<p>
				This page contains hidden text that can be revealed by pressing “Read more”. The read more only shows hidden contents, it does not lead you to a new page.
			</p>
			<h3>Career</h3>
			<p>
				This page contains different job listings. The listings are all shown in its full form, and nothing here is clickable.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, the site is made to be easily accessible, and the different subpages are all accessible from all the other pages through the top menu bar. This menu bar is made with big buttons with clear text, and makes it easy for the customer to navigate through the page. 
				Many known conventions are also used on this webpage. Eg. the menu on top, the about page, and other page descriptions and links.

				The design is made to look like chocolate. This appeals to a broad spectrum of customers, and is also easy to understand, because of the big button like chocolate pieces. The font used for the headers are in all caps. This makes it easy to read, and also to navigate for the younger crowd, as well as people with dyslexia and other sight impairments. All the colours and and illustrations are meant to increase a vibe of playfulness and candy. It is important not to make the site too childish, because the chocolate factory caters to people at all ages. This is done by making chocolate the main part of the design. Chocolate is universal to all ages. The design is also simple, and can be implemented as a responsive website if needed. The simpleness of the design makes it easy for the customer to find the information they are looking for. The fonts are all sans serif fonts, which are easier to read on screens.

					Content
				</h2>
			</header>
			<h3>Front page</h3>
			<p>
				The page is devided into tree columns. The columns are going to be styled with css floats or css flexbox. Which ever tool best suited for the task.  
				Each column contain a picture slideshow-box. With automated slideshow of pictures related to the topic in the headliner for each column. 
				Picture slideshow is written in javascript. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We want the frontpage to be a informal and clean website where the user finds the information he/she is looking for without any obstacles.

				</a>
            </figure>
			<h3>Products</h3>
			<p>
				The page contains pictures of chosen products from Charlies asortiment and a description of the product shown in picture placed below the image. The code for doing this is trivial html-code and css styling. We want the page to be clean with few confusing elements as possible. 
			</p>

            </figure>
			<h3>Product suggestions</h3>
			<p>
				The page contains a box designed to take input from the user of the page. This box asks for a name (required) and e-mail adress (required). The user have the option to describe the product he/she suggests and can also upload a product picture. 
				The input box takes the users input and sends it to a pre specified e-mail adress that belongs to the client (Willi Wonka).

            </figure>
			<h3>Career</h3>
			<p>
				The main purpose of the career page is to inform the visitor what vacant positions that are open to applicants. This might be interesting if the visitor is considering applying. Therefore the main content will be text, in categories about the positions, like “job description”, “deadline”, “info on how to apply” and “contact information”. All this text is to give the visitor important information about the positions. Each title of a vacant position will be in a different pastel color to decorate the page a little bit. Pastel colors will give the user associations to candy. Also for decoration there will be a border of candy which stretches from the title of the page. Even though this page is formal there should be a little decoration.
				The subtitles will be bolded out so it is clear that they are different from the rest of the text. The biggest part will be “job description” which describes the position, the rest are more like points of information. There might be several positions which will be shown under each other. Above them all there will be a title which reads “career”. If the browser window is full from too many positions, it will be necessary that the user scrolls to see all the information. Since this topic is formal, the page will be tidy with a font that looks somewhat official. No pictures are needed; decoration is not the main priority here. The text is normally sized.

            </figure>
			<h3>Contest</h3>
			<p>
				The contest page is mainly an informative page to give information about the running competition. Therefore, the main content is text about the competition, describing what the prize is and how to participate. The sides of the page should be covered with pictures to accommodate the text. These pictures will show chocolate bars, since chocolate is one of Charlie’s products. The picture is there so that the subject doesn’t look too formal. The pictures should be approximately 200x350px. There should be a title on the page which reads “Contest”.  Since the page is not meant to be very serious, the color of the title is yellow to be a bit more decorative.

					</figcaption>
				</a>
            </figure>
			<h3>Contest winner</h3>
			<p>
				A picture of a golden ticket will be shown to the user. It will be placed in the middle and will cover most of the browser window if the browser window is normally sized. At the bottom of the picture of the golden ticket there will be a text that reads “Click here to redeem your prize”. The picture of the golden ticket will be approximately 1200x500px.. When the picture is showing, the rest of the site is greyed out to suggest that it is not clickable. When clicked, the golden ticket disappears and text about how to redeem the prize appears. This is done with javascript. The text is informative and looks a lot like the “about” page.

            </figure>
			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				The about page is an informative page to let the visitor learn about the background of the company. At the top there will be a title which reads “About” and beneath it will be a text about the company’s background. Below this again there will be a link to a page called “Contact us”. The text in this link is black, but is underlined and has a different font to the normal one to show that it is a link. The page will have a footer which contains contact information like address and phone number. From the header there will be a dripping effect of chocolate to mix things up a bit between the pages. Also there should be an informative picture to illustrate the text’s point. This picture could show a logo or a picture of the factory.

            </figure>
			<h3>Charities</h3>
			<p>
				The style of this content is a mix of unordered lists (for each sponsor/charity program) and text blocks containing a small text about the list subject. 
			</p>
			<p>
				To manage to have the lists of sponsors/charities in one page, we will hide text behind a “read more”-link. Pressing the “read more” will expand the text.  (“read more” will not open a new html page).

            </figure>
			<h3>Contact us</h3>
			<p>
				This page contains a form which the user can fill in with a message to the company. This form consists of several text fields, ready for: Name, email and message. There will be text to remind the user what information is required. At the bottom of the form will be a “send” button which on pressing will save the message for the company to read. On the sides of the page will be a couple of decorative picture of candy, for instance of candy canes. These pictures are there to fill out an otherwise pretty empty page, and will be approximately 200x700px. These images will span most of the vertical length of the page. In the top middle of the page there will be the text “Contact us” with large letters for the user’s information. In order to accomplish this site JavaScript will be used to construct the form. When the user presses the “send”-button JavaScript should make sure that the inputted information should be sent to somewhere for the site owner to see. The database to save entries will not be implemented. This page looks simple and formal so that the user will feel like their opinion and feedback is important to the factory.
