In brief, we asked how easy the site was to navigate on a scale of 1-5, if any problems were encountered while trying to navigate the page, if so; what the problem was. Then, the user is asked if the site is tidy or not. Now follows fact-questions in order to determine if the user has gotten the information that we want him/her to get.

			<h2>Tester Audience</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			The users are friends of the developers, and are all 23-31 years old. It was simplest to ask our friends. There were three females and nine males among the testers. One big group the site aims at is kids, and they were not included in testing. This is since the site is for a thought-up client, and we thought that it was not important enough to ask kids.

			<h2>Your Response</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			The most important feedback is that the site is easy to navigate and use. The fact that not all users are able to answer a quiz about the content proves that either the information is not well enough shown, or the users are not that interested in reading the content. Particularly some pages will not be read thoroughly, because the users are interested more in other parts. It is not surprising that  the answers about charities is not as good as the one about the products. Products is also more important, since direct pr is one of the main aims of the site. Also, that the users reported that they now all wanted something sweet is very positive. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If it was wanted that the users remembered more facts, it would be a good idea to cut down on the text on the site. However, most users are not interested in learning and remembering facts, and so it is not considered very disappointing that they could not remember it.

			<h2>Self-reflection</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
			Gruppearbeid er litt ubehagelig pga stresset som følger med å måtte ta hensyn til andre. Foretrekker at våre fuck ups kun går ut over oss selv. 
			Enkelte av oss ser for seg at de neppe blir ferdig med utdanningsløpet fordi de kommer til å droppe framtidige gruppearbeid-fag.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ellers så var det interessant å få erfaring med hvordan arbeid som minner om arbeidslivet kan gå for seg. Og lærte også at sånn skisse av hvordan sidene blir å se ut er good shit.
