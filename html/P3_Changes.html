				<h2>Changes we have made</h2>
			</header>
			<h3>General</h3>
			<p>The font was changed to a nice webfont, bacause the Moon font was not availabel as a webfont. We fount another font that had the same "feeling" to it. We also made the whole page in Norwegian, so the sketches from the P2 are a bit dated. </p>

			<h3>Front page</h3>
			<p>In this page we ended up using CSS floats. The headings are not clickable, but every column has a read more link, and the pictures are also links to the associated pages</p>

			<h3>Product suggestion</h3>
			<p>Here we did not have the oppurtunity to send the mail directly to our client. This is due to a spcified requrement not to use any libraries. </p>

			<h3>Contact us page</h3>
			<p>In this page we added a button. Instead of just having to reload the page, the user may now push this button in order to win. </p>

			<h3>Contest winner</h3>
			<p>Here we changed the design of the golden ticket. We also added a unique, and random generated code to the ticket, to make
				sure no one could cheat in our contest. We also changed the functionality for escaping the winner-ticket popup. We did this because we were afraid that
				removing it by klicking anywhere on the page could lead to someone loosing their code. We did instead make a mechanism so that the user may press the esc button
				on their computer to get back to the normal page. </p>

			<h3>Charities</h3>
			<p>In this page we changed the placing of the coin illustrations. This was just a pure design desition from our (and Wonkas) side. This was to make it
			just a little more distiguishable from the career page. In stead of the "read more" we put the headings of the sponsorship programs and other charities
			as collapsable links. This lets the user choose what information they want to see on the page. We also made the email adress clickable, and by clicking
		the adress the user will be prompted to send an email from their installed email client. </p>

			<h3>Jobs</h3>
			<p>Here we added a fun little spinning animation to the candies. This was done mainly to hypnotize people into applying for the poster jobs (but don't tell them that).
			 </p>

			<h3>Contact us page</h3>
			<p>Like in the product suggestion page we had to removed the script that sends emails.</p>

				<h2>Modularity requirement</h2>
			</header>
				<p>Regarding the modularity requirement, after the page was wireframed and its
					basic design set, the team took a step back and looked at the individual parts
					to see if any code was re-used in another area of the website, and took steps to
					move such snippets into locations where they could be referred to instead of re-defined in each page.</p>
				<p>CSS commands that turned out to be useful in other sections was moved from the individual pages'
						 CSS files, into the general "mainStyle.css"-file, so that the individual pages' CSS files only
						 included tweaks and fixes for those particular pages. This ensures a more unified design, and simpler
						 management and further development.</p>
			 	<p>The Navigation bar was initially declared on every single page, which makes for very complicated
					management and lots of code repetition. These were replaced by a snippet of javascript that inserts the
					required elements straight into the pages.</p>
				<p> In order to increase the legibility of the codes and also to allow possible future re-use of javascript
					functions, all snippets of javascript from the pages were moved into separate javascript files.</p>

		<section id="requrements">
			<header>
				<h2>Minimum requrements</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Erik fulfilled the minimum requirements by making the image slideshow on the front page.</p>
			<p>Egil fulfilled the minimum requirements by making the script that lets you compete for a tour of the factory.
				He also made form validation for the contact form.</p>
			<p>Jarl fulfilled the minimum requirements by making the spinning animation for the career pages. He also made the form
			validation for the product suggest form, and a script for uploading a picture from your computer. </p>
			<p>John fulfilled the minimum requirements by making the script that shows or hides the extra information about the
			sponsorship programs of charlies chocolate factory. </p>
			<p>Silje fulfilled the minimum requirements by making the script that loads the html for the navbar into every page. </p>
